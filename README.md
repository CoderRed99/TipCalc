Week 1: Android Tip Calculator

Summary:
This is an Android app for calculating tip amount based on the user-selected percentage for a meal amount that is also entered by the user.

Time Spent:
12 hours?

Completed User Stories:
(Required)
● User is displayed the tip of specified percentage for specified entered amount
● User enters the total meal amount of the transaction
● User selects one of three tip amounts (10%, 15%, 20%)
● When the user selects tip %, tip total amount is displayed as $
(Optional)

● User changes the total meal amount and tip and total amounts are updated automatically
● User can enter a custom tip percentage if desired
● User changes the custom tip percentage and tip and total amounts are updated automatically

Note: It's really hard for me to tell exactly how long it took as I was completing projects and presentations for two of my finals and multi-tasking back and forth between the 3 projects.  I'll try to keep more accurate numbers next project.
